# Math Programs
Algorithms are everywhere. One area where I explore most of these is in my math class. Ever since I found my passion for programming, I usually doze off in class pondering on how I would create a program to solve these problems. As a hectic student with so much to learn, there's no better way to learn math and computer science at the same time than to write these programs!
## Matrix
This program allows the user to apply linear transformations (e.g. translation, reflection, rotation) to user defined 2x2 vectors. </br>
This Matrix program has: </br>
1) JRadioButtons to allow users to efficiently select which transformation they want to apply.</br>
2) JTextField for user to input their own transformation. </br>
2) JTextArea to record down all of the previous transformation results. </br>
4) try and catch to prevent the an error within the program. </br>

<strong>Instructions: </strong>By pressing calculate, it calculates all of the transformation in the same order it was inputted. The result is printed in the JTextArea. The transformations are resetted but the inputted vectors are not This program only does 2x2 and 1x1 matrixes. </br> <strong>NOTE </strong>The answer is displayed in terms of radians!</br>
